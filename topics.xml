          DEATH IN THE DYNAMO
          If the law i3 changed from hanging to
          death by electricity then it should and
          would bo made to include women as well as
          men. Any discrimination between the sexes
          would make the law unconstitutional."
          ""Would there b3 any objection to execut
          ing women with electricity.'"
          "No, sir; there would not. I think there
          would no longer be tho samo prejudico that
          thcro is now, because Imaging is a poor way
          of inflicting the death penalty."
          "How would you uso electricity?"
          "Just seo here," said Dr. Southwick,
          jumping up and .seating himself, in an arm
          chair. "Tho condemned man cansifc natur
          ally in a chair like this, placo his liands on
          the metal arms and converse with those
          around him. Tho metal plates would ba
          connected with a powerful d3namo and at
          tho proper moment somebody in another
          room would press a button, closo tho current
          and tho fatal shock would pass through tho
          body of the subject. Tho chargo would go
          straight through tho heart and lungs and
          penetrate the system, death instantly result
          ing.

          Theso 'executions
          could take place in tho jail proper, in a room
          set apart for that purpose, with no appli
          ances save that of a chair, with tuo nana
          rest of each arm properly connected with
          an electric machine, in which tho condemned
          might bo seated and tho connection made by
          strapping a hand to the hand rest on each
          chair. There can bo no difficulty whatever
          in procuring a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to paralyze tho muscles of
          tho heart by this method. Indeed, tho cur
          rent that is used in this city for electric
          lighting purposes is of sufficient strength to
          absolutely dismember the body of nay human
          being, but a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to cause instantaneous death
          by passing from hand to hand through the
          heart wi'l not mark the body in tho least.

          A PLAN PROPOSED
          murderers in New York
          sate will depart this life on a streak of light
          ing.
          The subject of putting murderers to death by electricity has
          been agitated in the Empire state for more
          than a year.
          After mature deliberation it was concluded
          that hanging would have to go.
          Hanging has been the fashionable mode of
          punishment for centuries, but a commission
          *appointed by Governor Hill concluded that it
          was too harrowing. They made a number
          of experiments, and finally decided upon
          electricity. A bill was passed by the legis
          lature, but-no provision was made as to the
          way the fluid was to be applied. Finally the
          Medico-legal society took the matter Uo, ap
          pointed a commission, and the result was
          that a particular form of applying the elec
          tricity was suggested.

          nefgro murderer, was brought into the

          Herman Rosenthal, the gambler for
          whose murder Charles Becker was sen
          tenced to die in the electric chair, was
          shot to death by hired gunmen in the
          early morning of July 16, 1912, in front
          of the Hotel Metropole on Forty-third
          street, a few stepB from Broadway.

          Becker was sentenced six

          HOW IT FEEKS TO DIE IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
          WHKN the electric chair was sub
          stituted for the old fashioned
          gallows in New York it was be
          cause it was believed that electrocution
          was painless. But just what were the
          sensations of death in the electric chair
          scientists were unable to say, because
          no electrocuted victim came back to life
          to tell tliern.

          the first electric
          execution arrived at the prison.
          New Tork State had just passed a
          law substituting the electric chair for
          the hangman's noose. There had
          never been an electric execution and
          everybody was prospecting as to who
          would be the first person electrocuted
          and'whether he would bo killed with
          out conscious suffering or tortured to

          Fare 5 cents each
          way! a boat trip over to the Statue
          of Liberty by way of Ellis Island, Gov
          ernors' Island. If you’re lucky like I
          am you might see the liners sailing in
          and out of New York Harbor. From
          about the middle of the foundation for
          the Statue we saw the Queen Mary put
          out to sea. She was a large, impressive
          looking liner but the fascination of the
          Statue sort of dulled the thrill of seeing
          England’s pride of the seas. Climbing
          into the crown of the Statue of Liberty
          is punishment that many patriotic
          Americans and ardent sightseers subject
          themselves to.

          DEATH IN THE DYNAMO
          If the law i3 changed from hanging to
          death by electricity then it should and
          would bo made to include women as well as
          men. Any discrimination between the sexes
          would make the law unconstitutional."
          ""Would there b3 any objection to execut
          ing women with electricity.'"
          "No, sir; there would not. I think there
          would no longer be tho samo prejudico that
          thcro is now, because Imaging is a poor way
          of inflicting the death penalty."
          "How would you uso electricity?"
          "Just seo here," said Dr. Southwick,
          jumping up and .seating himself, in an arm
          chair. "Tho condemned man cansifc natur
          ally in a chair like this, placo his liands on
          the metal arms and converse with those
          around him. Tho metal plates would ba
          connected with a powerful d3namo and at
          tho proper moment somebody in another
          room would press a button, closo tho current
          and tho fatal shock would pass through tho
          body of the subject. Tho chargo would go
          straight through tho heart and lungs and
          penetrate the system, death instantly result
          ing.

          Theso 'executions
          could take place in tho jail proper, in a room
          set apart for that purpose, with no appli
          ances save that of a chair, with tuo nana
          rest of each arm properly connected with
          an electric machine, in which tho condemned
          might bo seated and tho connection made by
          strapping a hand to the hand rest on each
          chair. There can bo no difficulty whatever
          in procuring a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to paralyze tho muscles of
          tho heart by this method. Indeed, tho cur
          rent that is used in this city for electric
          lighting purposes is of sufficient strength to
          absolutely dismember the body of nay human
          being, but a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to cause instantaneous death
          by passing from hand to hand through the
          heart wi'l not mark the body in tho least.

          A PLAN PROPOSED
          murderers in New York
          sate will depart this life on a streak of light
          ing.
          The subject of putting murderers to death by electricity has
          been agitated in the Empire state for more
          than a year.
          After mature deliberation it was concluded
          that hanging would have to go.
          Hanging has been the fashionable mode of
          punishment for centuries, but a commission
          *appointed by Governor Hill concluded that it
          was too harrowing. They made a number
          of experiments, and finally decided upon
          electricity. A bill was passed by the legis
          lature, but-no provision was made as to the
          way the fluid was to be applied. Finally the
          Medico-legal society took the matter Uo, ap
          pointed a commission, and the result was
          that a particular form of applying the elec
          tricity was suggested.

          Herman Rosenthal, the gambler for
          whose murder Charles Becker was sen
          tenced to die in the electric chair, was
          shot to death by hired gunmen in the
          early morning of July 16, 1912, in front
          of the Hotel Metropole on Forty-third
          street, a few stepB from Broadway.

          Becker was sentenced six

          HOW IT FEEKS TO DIE IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
          WHKN the electric chair was sub
          stituted for the old fashioned
          gallows in New York it was be
          cause it was believed that electrocution
          was painless. But just what were the
          sensations of death in the electric chair
          scientists were unable to say, because
          no electrocuted victim came back to life
          to tell tliern.

          the first electric
          execution arrived at the prison.
          New Tork State had just passed a
          law substituting the electric chair for
          the hangman's noose. There had
          never been an electric execution and
          everybody was prospecting as to who
          would be the first person electrocuted
          and'whether he would bo killed with
          out conscious suffering or tortured to

          Fare 5 cents each
          way! a boat trip over to the Statue
          of Liberty by way of Ellis Island, Gov
          ernors' Island. If you’re lucky like I
          am you might see the liners sailing in
          and out of New York Harbor. From
          about the middle of the foundation for
          the Statue we saw the Queen Mary put
          out to sea. She was a large, impressive
          looking liner but the fascination of the
          Statue sort of dulled the thrill of seeing
          England’s pride of the seas. Climbing
          into the crown of the Statue of Liberty
          is punishment that many patriotic
          Americans and ardent sightseers subject
          themselves to.

        <text>During a campaign the success of operations
          depends at most times on the
          rapidity with which the commanderin-chief
          is informed of the enemy's j
          movements. To this end use 1b made
          of cavalry patrols and of the field telegraph

          the safe arrival of Information none
          of these means is so reliable as the

          be made prisoners or killed, telegraph

          or be destroyed. These mishaps are
          avoided by the use of the carrier pigeon.
          In wcr time the role of cavalry consists
          more especially in seeing and in

        <text>Carrier Pigeon Brings Tidings
          From Far-Away Alaska.
          Ben Rowland of the firm of Row
          land Lucier, proprietors of the
          Hoffman bar, had his attention at
          tracted by a white pigeon Tuesday
          morning, which had fallen exhausted
          in front of his place of business. The
          bird made several attempts to fly,
          but was unable to make any distauce,
          and Mr. Rowland easily captured it.
          Upon examination he discovered it to
          be a carrier pigeon and about its leg
          was tied with a silk cord over a piece
          of buckskin a rubber nipple. Inside
          the nipple, carefully rolled in an oiled
          paper, was this message, written with
          pen and ink on a paper:
          "300 miles N. E. Dawson, Dec. 2,
          1904. Bill, the old place, if note is
          received O. K. come at once. Lots of
          gold. Finder of this bird please noti
          fy Wm. Raymond, address 2152 Mis
          sion St., San Francisco, Calif. Signed:
          Jim Orr."
          The pigeon's leg was badly irritated
          from the cord which the message was
          tied on with, and the flesh had been
          worn to the bone, showing that the
          bird had traveled a long distance.
          Mr. Rowland immediately wrote to
          the party mentioned in the message,
          and it is possible that a bit of history
          will develop from the pigeon's visit
          to Havre.</text>

          CARRIER PIGEONS HAVE BECOME PHOTOGRAPHERS
          IDFidHANKS
          NOWADAYS, since there are so
          many means of sending' mes
          sages from one person* to an
          other, pigeons, which used to have con
          siderable work to do as messenger
          boys, have been extremely idle and
          have largely devoted themselves to
          sauntering about in the air and adding
          to the beauty of the landscape. But re
          cently It has been found that there are
          other ways of employing these birds on
          Important missions besides sending
          them on long distance flights as mes
          senger boys. The particular new field
          for pigeon activities which has been
          discovered is that of photography.
          These pigeon photographers were
          first started on their mission in life in
          Germany, where a physician had been
          in the habit of sending carrier pigeons
          from his office in the city to a sana
          torium in the nearby country. Medicine,
          pills and powders were put in a little
          satchel and tied to one of the pigeons,
          which carried them from the doctor's
          office to the sanatorium.
          At last one day a pigeon with a very
          Important message was despatched
          from the sanatorium to the doctor's
          office, and although the bird was cele
          brated for Its speed and trustworthiness
          it did not appear at the end of Its
          journey for a month. The same thing
          later happened to another bird, and the
          owners of the pigeons became very
          curious to know what had become of
          them. Finally it occurred to some one
          that since the pigeons are able to carry
          one-third of their weight it would be
          possible to attach small cameras to
          the birds so that when they wandered
          away they would return with a record
          of their wanderings on the plate of the
          camera.</text>

          bearers In times of war. they have

          Aliens Restrictions Act; and about the
          same time a German spy was arrested th
          Belgium with pigeons In his possession
          under suspicious circumstances. He was
          found ostensibly fishing by the banks of
          the Heuse, and sitting on a basket. When
          asked what luck he had, he replied,
          "None, the beggars won't bite." Just
          then, unfortunately for him, "unmistakable
          sounds of "cooing" came from the basket.
          What happened to him may easily be
          Imagined. The pigeons are said to have
          been "fairly tender!"

          By 1874 there wero military pigeon lofU
          at Cologne, MeU, Strassburg and
          Baden. Thu Emperor gave prizes to
          eticourago the sport of pigeon racing.
          Ten years' after the war thero wero
          no fewer than 178 private homing
          pigeon societies In Germany owning a
          total of 52,240 pigeons, exclusive of the
          military flocks.
          Evtry nation In Europe look up the
          breeding nnd training of homing pigeon
          for use In tlmo of war. Italy followed
          next after Franco and Germany In 1876,
          At the present time Italy has sixteen
          military pigeon lofts. Russia has live
          military pigeon lofts. Spain has a mag-

          SINCE tho days of Pharoah the
          carrier pigeon has played an
          Important part in warfare. De
          spito tho perfection of tho wired
          W and wireless telegraph and telephone,
          V wig-wagging and other means of
          j transmitting messages from head
          quarters to flcld commanders, nothing
          has yet been invented, unless it is tho
          aeroplane, that makes these means of
          communication absolutely safo from
          I prying eyes and ears. Therefore, now
          j as heretofore, the crmics of the world

          is at Lansdownc, Pa., where that well
          known Philadelphia sportsman, An
          thony J Drcxol Blddlc, now a Captain
          In tho United States Marino Corps, is
          devoting much tlmo to supervising
          tho training of the birds.
          Record Breakers In Flock.
          In this coto are many birds that
          hold records for speed and distance
          flights. Charles Jones, presldont of
          tho National Carrier Pigeon Associa
          tion, has taken a keen Interest In tho
          new army flock and turned over two
          of his record breaking birds, "Undo
          Sam" and "Botty. "Uncle Sam"
          still holds the record for an over
          sea flight of 500 miles, while "Betty's"
          600-inllo straightaway flight never
          has been equalled.
          It is generally conceded that tho
          safest way to conceal a message to be
          borno by a carrier pigeon is to en
          fold It in a little tube that is tuckod
          beneath tho bird's wing. Sometimes
          tho noto is tied to its leg, or about
          Its neck, but the tubo is moro popu
          lar. When a homing pigeon is re
          leased for its home flight It generally
          soars to a tremendous altitude in
          order to get its bearings. When It
          has established its sense of direction
          it darts away in straight flight to Its
          goal, or cote. As tho bird flies bo
          swiftly and at such a great altitude
          tho chances of Its being shot by an
          enemy sharpshooter Is romoto In ths
          extreme and for this reason tho
          chances for Its bringing homo tho
          messago with trhlch it was entrusted

          Birds Used By Pershinp:.

          sively used onco tho American "Sam-
          A

          General Pershing and his staff al
          ready havo had occasion to uso them.
          In the American coto are birds that
          are tho progeny of "Simny.JJm." one
          of the most noted homing birds In the
          world. Jim electrified the homing
          fanciers of tho world a few years ago
          by a flight from Rio dc Janoiro to
          Jeannctte, Pa a distance of 4,200
          miles. It was tho flrst time a bird
          of its kind ever winged Us way from
          a point south of tho Equator. Jim
          was liberated at Rio on May S, 1913.
          Twenty-four hours afterwards ht re
          turned to tho point of liberation, cir
          cled about the cote for an hour or so
          land then headed due north. Whether
          it was tho intenso heat, or tho great
          distance, most of which was ovor
          strange and unfamiliar surroundings
          abounding In denso tropical foliage,
          none knows, but in any event Sunny
          Jim did not return to this Pennsyl
          vania cote until twenty-four days after
          his liberation in the tropics. Bu' tho
          all important point is, ho arrived.
          Whereas tho natural instinct of tho
          carrier pigeon is to seek his cote the
          moment ho is liberated at some dis
          tant point, nevertheless tho armies
          of tho worid aro not relying on in
          stinct alone. Theso birds aro train
          ed Just as diligently and assiduously
          as any other part of the wonderful
          units that aro being so masterfully
          weldod Into a perfect war machine.
          The training is only accomplished af
          tor weeks and months of patient effort
          and now that tho time has arrived
          for our army to tako its placo in tho
          foreign battio line, great faith Is ho
          ling pinned to tho feathered tribe that
          is being transported across tho seas.
          Dates Back to Pliaroah.
          The part tho homing pigeons played
          in the affairs of the world as previous
          ly stated, dates back to tho days when
          Pharoah's navigators wero sailing to
          Egypt and released these homing
          birds to let those at homo know tho
          dato of their expected return. In tho
          seventh century, history tells us, the
          Arabs maintained a regular pigeon
          posu Tho burdens of tho Dutch dur
          ing tho sicgo of Leyden, wore mate
          rially lightened by tho swift, flying
          pigeons which conveyed their mes
          sages and kept the lines of communi
          cation open and safe.
          Tho real valuo of tho homing pig
          eon In war was best demonstrated
          during tho slego of Paris in the Franco-Prussian
          war, Just forty-four, years
          ago. In tho course of this slego seventy-four
          balloons were sent aloft all
          frolghtcd with homing pigeons which
          wero destined for Tours and other
          points. It is said that upwards of
          800 pigeons wero sont from tho Prov
          inces to Paris during the slego and
          that tho momentous messages they
          conveyed would make a library of
          500 volumes. It was Just prior to tho
          siege that Barreswill and Dragon per
          fected a process of mlcrophotography
          by which two to three thousand letters
          could bo photographed on a film two
          Inches long by an inch and a half
          wide. By placing tho negative or
          positives In a storeopticon and throw
          ing them on a screen, tho messages
          Could easily bo read. More than 40,
          000 such messages wero sont whllo
          tho slego lasted.

          Immediately after signing tho
          treaty of peace Bismarck, realizing
          tho importanco of a plgoon post In

          before ua li standardization," said tho
          Council of National Dofonso in a re
          cent statement, "The American de

          talncd soleJy for the use of tho army
          and Germany's army has been using
          the homing pigeon to a considerable
          extent ever sinco. By IS 74 thero we:o
          official pigeon cotes established at Co
          logne. Metz, Strassburg and Baden.
          To stlmulato the interest in broed
          lng homing pigeons tho Kalsor gave
          annual prizes for the swiftest and
          strongest birds and ten years after
          tho war thero wero ITS private hom
          ing pigeon societies In Germany own
          ing a total of 62,24 0 birds, cxcluslvo
          of thoso In the army cotes.
          Germany's Interest in the homing
          pigeon was a stimulus to that In other
          countries. Italy followed tho ex
          ample set by France and Germany
          and her cotes ever since havo been
          world renowned. Sho now has six
          teen army lofts, all filled with tho
          very highest type of birds that brood
          ers can produce. Russia has five of
          theso military lofts and this means
          several thousand birds, to say nothing
          of the new crop of young birds that
          annually come on, for tho pigeon is
          prolific as a breeder.
          Spain Uas Fine Ixfts.
          Spain has a magnificent collection
          of homing pigeons and its official lofts
          are among tho finest in the world. Its
          eighteen lofts, all under military su
          pervision, aro scattored through tho
          kingdom with a trainod body of sol
          diers to look after and train tho birds.
          Portugal,. llko her neighbor, has gono
          In scientifically for pigeon breeding
          and uses them extonslvoly for army
          and sccrot scrvlco purposes. Portu
          gal has fourteon lofts; Sweden and
          Denmark flvo each. Holland has no
          But all said and dono France leadB
          tho world In tho utilization of tho
          carrlor pigeon. Thero aro upwards
          of 100,000 birds in the hands of skilled
          breeders and trainers throughout that
          Republic, all of which aro subject to
          bo commandeored by tho government
          at an Instant's notice. As It Is France,
          learning tho. value of theso winged
          mossengers in the Franco-Prussian
          war, now has twenty-eight military
          pigeon lofts, most of them along tho
          eastern boundary in tho vicinity of tho
          battle front- There are 100 birds in
          each of tnese lofts.
          French scientists after a series of
          exhaustlvo experiments have decided
          that tho homing pigeon relics upon tho jH
          sense of smell, rather than that of
          sight, to find its way home. This do
          clslon was reached after testing every
          sense theso birds aro endowed with.
          Tho senses of sight, hearing and smell
          wero all deadened In turn. First tho
          birds wero turned looso far from
          home and blindfolded. They arrived
          at their cote according to schedule.
          Then their ears wore scaled with wax fM
          and still they arrlvod. But when their
          nostrils were closed with wax tho
          birds becamo bewildered and helpless JM
          and floundered around, soon refusing
          to fly at all. Tho scientist's cxplana- IH
          tlon is that each locality has its indl
          vidual odor for tho homing pigeon,
          and by circling aloft the pigeon final
          ly gets into tho air current frolghted
          with tho odor of tho pigeon's home lo
          callty and by following this curront
          ho arrives ultimately at his cote.
          230 Miles In Five Hours. j IH
          A flight of 250 miles in from flvo to
          soven hours is regarded as an ordi-
          nary feat for a pigeon. A fow can
          make 500 or 600 miles In tho satao
          time. Somo of tho best records over
          attained wero hung up by American
          birds. A bird namod Nym, owned jH
          and bred by J. R. Husson of Cresson.
          Pa., flew from Now York City to
          Cresson, a distance of 243 miles, in JH
          337 minutes. That was away back in

          The most Important usp of the
          pigeon, next to that in maintaining
          liaison between forces under fire, is
          to carry messages from aerial observ
          ers, whether in balloon or Diane.
          Pigeons released at an elevation eight
          thousand feet have successfully re
          turned to their coops, and they are
          regularly flown from the e'evation of
          six thousand. If the thins- is skill-
          fully done, the bird can be released
          from a plane traveling at one hun
          dred miles an hour. And for this use
          pigeons have the great advantage over
          all other means of communication In
          that they can carry a small map or
          uiteen reet or moving picture film.

          upon ttie pigeon to bring news of the rec-ua
          of some grea; sea fifiht.
          Uncie Sam, in the person of Secretary
          Horbert. of the Navy, has lonp been con
          vinced of the utiiity cf the pigeon as a
          messenger in time cf war. If a sea fitrht
          took place anywhere on the Atlantic within
          100, 200 or even 200 miles it would be poo-
          fible,
          by means of the carrier pieeon, to
          hive news of it in comparatively rhnrt time.
          If a war vessel 0:1 criast defense duty
          wanted aid At a given time and a: a stated
          place it would be possible to communicate
          the fact the Navy Department by means
          of the winded rcesF;enrerf and thus insure
          a great vicfry, or stave off what would
          otherwise be certain defeat. In fact, the
          i:sc to which the-e piareons rn be put
          could be enunit-rptec by the hund'-ed.
